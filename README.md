#Excel Dummy Project for Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of dummy Excel projects created to showcase my skills and knowledge in data analysis, spreadsheet management, and Excel functionality. The projects are designed to simulate real-world scenarios and demonstrate my ability to use various Excel features such as formulas, pivot tables, charts, data visualization, and automation techniques.

Feel free to explore the files, review the approach used in each project, and get an idea of how I apply Excel tools to solve problems. This repository is intended to serve as a part of my professional portfolio.
